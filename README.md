We use four data sets collected from the Brazilian higher education census conducted in 2018, URL: http://portal.inep.gov.br/basica-levantamentos-acessar. We are interested in analyzing the first-year dropout rate in undergraduate courses, which is defined as the proportion of students who withdraw the course before completing the first-year. To this aim, we selected the presential courses with more than 29 new students and positive first-year dropout rates in the census academic year. The data sets are provided in .csv files, and a brief description is given below.

<ul>
 <li> data1.csv: Civil engineering courses. 
 <li> data2.csv: Economics courses. 
 <li> data3.csv: Computer sciences courses.  
 <li> data4.csv: Control engineering courses.
  <li> Variable description:
    <ul>
      <li> CO_CURSO: unique identification code of the course in the census. </li>
      <li> NO_IES: Name of the university to which the course belongs. </li>
      <li> DROPOUT_RATE: the proportion of 2018 freshmen students who were transferred to another course of the same higher education institution or were detached from the course. </li>
    </ul>
